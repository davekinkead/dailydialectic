# The Daily Dialectic

The Daily Dialectic is a forum for presenting bite sized chunks of public philosophy served (almost) daily.  Visit the [website](http://dave.kinkead.com.au/dailydialectic) for more details.

## Proposing a talk

To propose a talk, follow these (hopefully) simple instructions:

1. Signup to github.com if you don't already have an account.
2. Fork the daily dialectic repo.
3. Add a file for your talk named `your-talk-name.md` to the _bites folder and ensure that the metadata in the file resembled the one below.
4. Submit a pull request.
5. Or if that's too hard, just [email your proposal](mailto:d.kinkead@uq.edu.au?subject=The Daily Dialectic - I would give up my third born to present!) to me.

## Dialectic Files

Proposals for dialectics need to be written in markdown. Don't worry - if you can write an email, you already know how to write markdown.  Markdown files need to start with some front matter like this:
