Demarchy is a type of democracy that moves power out of the hands of career politicians and instead puts it into the control of those who are affected by the issues. Democratic functions are decentralized and any person who has a legitimate interest in a given function is eligible to participate in the decision-making of that function, through a random selection process.

Higher order procedural committees were suggested as a means of providing oversight, guidance and a quasi-judicial role by arbitrating disputes between committees. Membership in these higher order committees would be based on experience in functional committees, creating a more deliberative body with proven competence.

It is my contention that these structures should be re-conceptualized as a weak bicameralism; a type of democracy that uses two decision-making bodies that have unequal constitutional powers. The upper house may have a right to veto any of the legislation emanating from the lower houses, but their purpose is oversight, not functional.
