Part .8 in a 3.14.. part series

This is not an embassy. A  hybrid of rationalism and pragmatism. A return to rationalism via pragmatist premises. A different kind of pragmatism â€“ a pragmatic justification for epistemological system. Theology of science. Not a return to architectonic though. More like town planning. Many agencies. We work out the infrastructure, the epistemological integration. The universe is made of 1's and 0's. There will be a novel re-reading of Hume's problem of induction. Mathematics is the gateway to divine knowing. God doesn't exist, but following Voltaire's suggestion we invent Hir, just so our head stops bumping the door way on our way to the future. Mathematical abstraction? Music bridges the divide between numbers and our fractal edges. Dance dance dance to the radio. But mostly just a novel re-reading of Hume's problem of induction and a heterodox reconstruction of Nietzsche as ratio-pragmatist (man is a bridge between ape and man-machine). The Kant rabbit-hole gets filled with silicone. This is not an embassy. The man-machine. Super human being. The man-machine-machine-machine-machine-machine-machine-machine. #accelerate
