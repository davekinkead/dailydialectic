Sita Haran is a novelette about the struggles of a young sindhi woman, displaced by the partition of Indian and Pakistan, along arbitrary lines. In her fate she is similar to the legendary Indian heroin Sita, whose tragedy was triggered by her abduction. In my talk I would try to engage with the idea of the abduction of this modern day Sita, whose abduction was not an event in real time by any real Ravana, nonetheless this virtual abduction damaged her world beyond repair.
