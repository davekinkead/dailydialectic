Luciano Floridi has argued for an agent-oriented view of relevance - something is relevant to some rational agent if such a rational agent would request specific information if informed in broader terms that new information regarding some topic is available.

I will argue that we need some means to determine whether some piece of information is relevant to an agent. Specifically, I will argue for a goal-oriented view of relevance. Such a view is strong enough to plug nicely into information ethics, specifically into debates about entitlement to information.
