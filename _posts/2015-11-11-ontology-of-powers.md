I will discuss one of my overseas adventures - the Powers, Perception and Agency at the British School at Rome. It won't be a super well-prepared talk - think of it as more like a magazine advertisement for a new product. So an ontology of powers? We can think of this as an alternative to an ontology of objects or processes. It's a third option! I will then chat about how powers apply to perception and agency.
