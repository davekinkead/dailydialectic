Some justifications of democracy are egalitarian.  According to philosophers like Peter Singer & Ronald Dworkin, democracy has value because it embodies political equality.

But _equality_ is one of those essentially contested terms and a great deal hinges on exactly which conception of equality democracy requires.  One way of fleshing out differences in the notion of equality is thinking of it as either _procedurally_ or _substantively_.  

Procedural equality requires treating relevant people the same. It is an agent-blind conception that doesn't make distinctions between agents and treats everyone the same.  Substantive equality, by contrast, requires that a process actually realises equality.  It permits treating different people differently in order to achieve equality.

Procedural equality, however, is too weak a concept to do the necessary normative work of legitimating democracy.  Why should we care if a process treats people the same when it doesn't actually _realise_ political equality?  If it is actual equality that matters, then we must focus of substantive equality.

In this dialectic, I want to explore the relationship between procedural and substantive equality and answer the question: 'Under what conditions does procedural equality map substantive equality, and under what conditions does it not?'.  I will then attempt to demonstrate that egalitarian justifications of democratic authority fail under normal conditions because they cannot reliably produce equal outcomes.
