Whether morals exist as objective things or facts in the world is an important philosophical problem. Whether we can come to know these things or facts is yet a further problem. And whether we can come to know that we know them is a third problem that plagues the doctrine of moral objectivity. Because these problems persist, it is best to operate within a context of moral subjectivity (because this is just what we do anyway). In such a context, given that everyone decides what is right or wrong without some objective marker, is ethics even possible and does it make sense?
