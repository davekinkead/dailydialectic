Success for humans can be assessed in very different ways. Each of these assessments starts out by identifying and focusing upon a certain aspect of the human phenomenon. For example, we may be assessed as reproducers (by biologists), as utility maximisers (by economists), or as thinkers (by philosophers). Each of these entities (and others) has a very different standard for success, but all share a common origin, so some end up assisting or inhibiting the functioning of others. And humans are not the only things that self-perpetuate and  evolve to new circumstances: social norms can be viewed as entities in this way too. I want to consider the prospects for yet another entity, the stable society, given that it is composed of these many-faceted humans and the norms and concepts which inhabit and shape them.
