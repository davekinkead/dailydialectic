Democracy begins with the people; democratic theory simply presupposes them. But democratic theory is silent on who ought be included amongst the people. It canâ€™t, because any democratic process first requires the identification of some determinate group of agents - the demos - in order to act democratically.  

This problem of the people - the question of how should we determine the _demos_ - has become know as the Boundary Problem of democratic theory.  And despite a flury of recent papers on the subject, we seem no closer to finding a solution.

That's because the _Boundary Problem_ referes to three distinct but related questions about democracy, justice, and authority.  So in this little bite of philosophy, I expore three perspectives in the literature - the democrat, the cosmopolitan, and the anarchist - and show that while each may solve the Boundary Problem for their own purposes, none can solve it for the others.
