In this talk I will try to sketch a simple account of ‘dialectical reasoning’, and demonstrate why it is a bad idea. Dialectical reasoning begins with two imperfect ideas and tries to create a third, better, option through a ‘synthesis’ of the previous two. I will discuss why this might be tempting, and why the temptation should be avoided. Hopefully there will be a positive message in what I have to say as well.
