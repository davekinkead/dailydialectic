'If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear' – but you do have plenty to hide, and plenty to fear.  This is clear from the fact that you are able to read this message – you need to be alive, literate, and be able to access the Internet in order to do so. This capacity brings a whole lot of baggage along with it.  You're soft, squishy, and with the right (wrong) push vulnerable to financial, social, and physical ruin. 

 There's a lot of talk of protecting privacy (and giving it up to protect security), but little talk of how privacy protects this squishy, embarrassing, potentially (probably) poor you.  Privacy can be conceived of as a means rather than an end – and this way of thinking about it is pretty damn fruitful.  

This talk will feature arguments from several videos for WTPhi – ask Dave or I about it, I promise you will be only vaguely disappointed.
