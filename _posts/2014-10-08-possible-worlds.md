We live on the actual universe. We experience actual events. We can extrapolate near and far actual events. The actual universe is the totality of all these actual events.

So it makes sense for us when we say, our actual universe could have have turned out differently than what it actually is now.

The question is, in virtue of what does it make sense to say "could have turned out differently"?

Some academics argue that statements about possible worlds have truth values because possible worlds actually exist out-there while some have said our statements about them is what makes them true.

I take the view that statements about them is what makes them true. Unfortunately this view presents me with a challenge of trying to articulate how it is possible that God can know possible worlds.
