The Daily Dialectic is an informal approach to philosophy. A group of us - philosophy grad students at UQ - thought it would be fun to listen to short philosophical arguments over coffee and biscuits.

It's a chance for us philosopher types to try out new interesting arguments and polish our oratory skills in a fun and friendly atmosphere.

### What's a dialectic?

A dialectic is neither a demonstration nor debate. It's a method of argument whereby two opposing ideas are examined in order to find the truth. We are pretty relaxed on what constitutes a dialectic though.


### Why only 15 minutes?

Because 15 minutes roughly corresponds to our attention spans and the onset caffeine withdrawal symptoms. And anything longer tends to become too formal.


### Who can come?

The Daily Dialectic is for anyone interested in philosophy and/or coffee & biscuits. If you're an undergrad, grad student, faculty, or just otherwise interested, you are more than welcome to attend.


### Who can present?

As above - anyone can present. Just [email us a pitch](contact) and we'll try and slot you in.

### What is the format?

We meet in the level 5 foyer of the Michie building any time before 10:30am. The dialectic starts at 10:30 sharp and there is a stick 15 minute time limit. Q&A and coffee follows until we get bored or are forced back to work.

The presentations are public in the sense that any can walk by and listen. Kind of like this, only with less mud and fewer gourds. That also means there are no distractions like whiteboards and power point presentations.


### Why do you call it daily when it's only on twice a week?

The same reason the Women's Weekly is published monthly and countries with the word 'Democratic' in their name aren't. Because marketing.
