          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <ul class="questions">
            <li class="question">
              <h4>What's all this about then?</h4>
              <p>The Daily Dialectic is an informal approach to philosophy.  A group of us - philosophy grad students at UQ - thought it would be fun to listen to short philosophical arguments over coffee and biscuits.</p>
              <p>It's a chance for us philosopher types to try out new interesting arguments and polish our oratory skills in a fun and friendly atmosphere.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>What's a dialectic?</h4>
              <p>A dialectic is neither a demonstration nor debate. It's a method of argument whereby two opposing ideas are examined in order to find the truth. We are pretty relaxed on what constitutes a dialectic though.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>Why only 15 minutes?</h4>
              <p>Because 15 minutes roughly corresponds to our attention spans and the onset caffeine withdrawal symptoms.  And anything longer tends to become too formal.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>Who can come?</h4>
              <p>The Daily Dialectic is for anyone interested in philosophy and/or coffee &amp; biscuits.  If you're an undergrad, grad student, faculty, or just otherwise interested, you are more than welcome to attend.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>Who can present?</h4>
              <p>As above - anyone can present. Just <a href="mailto:d.kinkead@uq.edu.au">email us a pitch</a> and we'll try and slot you in.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>What is the format?</h4>
              <p>We meet in the level 5 foyer of the Michie building any time before 10:30am.  The dialectic starts at 10:30 sharp and there is a stick 15 minute time limit.  Q&amp;A and coffee follows until we get bored or are forced back to work.</p>
              <p>The presentations are public in the sense that any can walk by and listen.  Kind of like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmyuE0NpNgE">this</a>, only with less mud and fewer gourds.  That also means there are no distractions like whiteboards and power point presentations.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="question">
              <h4>Why do you call it daily when it's only on twice a week?</h4>
              <p>The same reason the Women's Weekly is published monthly and countries with the word 'Democratic' in their name aren't. Because marketing.</p>
